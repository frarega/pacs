Challange 4.2

Scalar type is stored in "scalar.hpp" (you may choose to change it) and then recompile.
The executable performs main operations on some given polynomials; then it asks the user to type two polynomials, and performs the same operations with them.
Remember to type coefficients form the constant term to the leading term. Just type "Enter" to terminate the sequence.

Remark: a polynomial<D> is just formally of degree D. Indeed, the actual degree may be fewer than D (if the leading coefficient(s) equals zero)
